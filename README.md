### Sylvain Lafitte
#### Head of Design in Melbourne
I'm a product design leader, I help businesses design and ship useful products that are easy to use.

Currently Head of Design at [Up](https://up.com.au/), helping people feel good about their money.

Previously I was a Product Design Director at [Culture Amp](https://www.cultureamp.com/), where I led and managed the team working on our Engagement product â€” helping companies understand and improve the experience of their employees.

Prior to that, I worked at [Xero](https://www.xero.com/), where I helped define, design and deliver end-to-end product experiences to help millions of small businesses be successful. I led several key projects and managed a team of designers, but I was also responsible for contributing to the wider design strategy, along with managing and improving our design team systems and processes.
