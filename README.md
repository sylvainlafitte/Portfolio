### Sylvain Lafitte
#### Product Designer living in Melbourne.
I'm a product design leader, I help businesses solve problems to improve people’s lives.

Currently Product Design Director at [Culture Amp](https://www.cultureamp.com/), where I lead and manage the team working on our Engagement product — helping companies understand and improve the experience of their employees.

Previously at [Xero](https://www.xero.com/), where I helped define, design and deliver end-to-end product experiences to help millions of small businesses be successful. I led several key projects and managed a team of designers, but I was also responsible for contributing to the wider design strategy, along with managing and improving our design team systems and processes.
