### Sylvain Lafitte
#### Product Designer living in Melbourne.
Designing useful and usable products with a focus on content and simplicity.

I facilitate interactions between people and their environment by designing clear and user-friendly interfaces. My goal is to understand the needs of the business and its users, and to identify the problems they face in order to design, test, and implement the optimal solution and work towards the ideal interactions, whatever the device may be.

Now full time at [Xero](http://xero.com/ "Xero - Beautiful Accounting Software"), where I help define, design and deliver end-to-end product experiences, to help millions of small businesses be successful, profitable and efficient.
I'm a Lead Designer across several key projects, but also responsible for contributing to the wider design strategy, looking after key relationships with product leaders and other teams, assisting other designers through mentorship, along with managing and improving our design team systems and processes.</p>
