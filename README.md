### Sylvain Lafitte
#### Product Designer living in Melbourne.
Designing useful and usable products with a focus on content and simplicity.
The simpler the better.

I facilitate interactions between people and their environment by designing clear and user-friendly interfaces. My goal is to understand the needs of the business and its users, and to identify the problems they face in order to design, test, and implement the optimal solution and work towards the ideal interactions, whatever the device may be.
